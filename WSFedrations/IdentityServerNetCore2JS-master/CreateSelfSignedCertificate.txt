How to create a Self signed certificate in windows 10 and export it to a file

First launch powershell as administrator and issue the following command

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname *.dmm888.com

(dmm888.com is the domain name)

The output will be:

Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------
BBCEFBE3BDDBADD1**FEF13C****8BB1B9  CN=*.dmm888.com

Second
create the following variable:
$CertPwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String “YourPassword” -Force –AsPlainText

and finally issue the export command using the Thumbprint:

Export-PfxCertificate -cert cert:\localMachine\my\BBCEFBE3BDDBADD1**FEF13C****8BB1B9 -FilePath c:\certs\dmm.pfx -Password $CertPwd

The certificate must then placed in the project and copied in the output directory if newer

To be able to verify the JWT signature we need to get the public key of it.
we can proceed in the following way:

Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath c:\certs\dmm.pfx | Export-Certificate -FilePath dm.cer -Type Cert

and finally we need to convert to base64 string with the following command

certutil -encode dm.cer dmbase64.cer

The content of the file dmbase64.cer will contain the public key that can be pasted in the verification text at jwt.io
in order to verify the signature of the token.
