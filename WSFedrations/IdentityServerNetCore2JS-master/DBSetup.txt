In order to properly setup this environment it is recommended to run the 

IdentityServerAdminAspUsers and create the database by typing

update-database in the Package Manager console.

It is Mandatory to have a valid Sql Server connection string to provide in the appsetting.json

for example

 "DefaultConnection": "Integrated Security=SSPI;Persist Security Info=False;Initial Catalog=AspNetSecurity;Data Source=localhost"

 Then after creating an user it is possible to launch the Identity Server and use the implicit flow in the JavascriptClient project

 Alternatively it is also possible require an access token to the identity server by following the flow of the OauthClientReact project

 To configure identity server with Entity Framework follow the example below
