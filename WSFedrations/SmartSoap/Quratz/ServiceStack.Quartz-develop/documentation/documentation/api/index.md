<!--title: Api-->

The plugin exposes an API where you can view and control the scheduler, jobs and triggers.

If you have the metadata plugin enabled, a 'Quartz' link will be registered on the default metadata page.

* Scheduler API - *http://{hostaddress}:{port}/quartz/api*

The endpoints provide information about the job executions, triggers and history as well as the 
ability to start, pause, stop and resume scheduling.
