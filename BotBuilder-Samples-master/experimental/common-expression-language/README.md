# Common Expression Language ***_[PREVIEW]_***

Bots, like any other application, require use of expressions to evaluate outcome of a condition based on runtime information available in memory or to the dialog or the language generation system. 

Common expression language was put together to address this core need as well as to rationalize and snap to a common expression language that will be used across Bot Framework SDK and other conversational AI components that need an expression language.

See [here](./api-reference.md) for API reference.

***_An expression is a sequence that can contain one or more [operators](#Operators), [variables](#Variables), [explicit values](#Explicit-values), [pre-built functions](./prebuilt-functions.md) or [Language Generation templates](../fileformats/lg/README.md#Template)._***

## Variables
Variables are always referenced by their name. E.g. {myVariable}
Variables can be complex objects. In which case they are referenced either using the property selector operator e.g. myParent.myVariable or using the item index selection operator. E.g. myParent.myList[0]. or using the [parameters](TODO) function. 

## Explicit values
Explicit values are enclosed in single quotes 'myExplicitValut' or double quotes - "myExplicitValue".
